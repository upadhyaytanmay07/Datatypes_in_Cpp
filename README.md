ðŸ§­ AIM: 
To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

ðŸ“š THEORY: 
Data types specify the type of data that a variable can store. Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data type with which it is declared as every data type requires a different amount of memory. C++ supports a wide variety of data types, and the programmer can select the data type appropriate to the needs of the application.

CHARACTER DATA TYPE (char): 
The character data type is used to store a single character. The keyword used to define a character is char. Its size is 1 byte, and it stores characters enclosed in single quotes (' '). It can generally store up to 256 characters according to their ASCII codes.

INTEGER DATA TYPE (int): 
Integer data type denotes that the given variable can store the integer numbers. The keyword used to define integers is int. Its size is 4 bytes (for 64-bit systems) and can store numbers for binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal base systems in the range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

BOOLEAN DATA TYPE (bool): 
The boolean data type is used to store logical values: true (1) or false (0). The keyword used to define a boolean variable is bool. Its size is 1 byte.

FLOATING POINT DATA TYPE (float): 
Floating-point data type is used to store numbers with decimal points. The keyword used to define floating-point numbers is float. Its size is 4 bytes (on 64-bit systems) and can store values in the range from 1.2e-38 to 3.4e+38.

DOUBLE DATA TYPE (double): 
The double data type is used to store decimal numbers with higher precision. The keyword used to define double-precision floating-point numbers is double. Its size is 8 bytes (on 64-bit systems) and can store the values in the range from 1.7e-308 to 1.7e+308.

ðŸ§ª IMPLEMENTATION: 
In this code, I have asked the user for input for various datatypes and I have printed out the type and the size of the datatype.

To run this code, copy the code in Visual Studio and run the program.

âœ… CONCLUSION: 
In this practical, I discovered about various types of datatypes available in C++.
